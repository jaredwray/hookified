## Features
- Emit Events via [Emittery](https://npmjs.com/package/emittery)
- Async Middleware Hooks for Your Methods
- ESM and Nodejs 20+
- Maintained on a regular basis!

Special thanks to [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) for the [Emittery](https://npmjs.com/package/emittery) library. üçª

## Installation
```bash
npm install hookified --save
```

## Usage
This was built because we constantly wanted hooks and events extended on libraires we are building such as [Keyv](https://keyv.org). This is a simple way to add hooks and events (via [emittery](https://npmjs.com/package/emittery)) to your libraries.

```javascript
import { Hookified } from 'hookified';

class MyClass extends Hookified {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async myMethodEmittingEvent() {
    await this.emit('message', 'Hello World'); //using Emittery
  }

  //with hooks you can pass data in and if they are subscribed via onHook they can modify the data
  async myMethodWithHooks() Promise<any> {
    let data = { some: 'data' };
    // do something
    await this.hook('before:myMethod2', data);

    return data;
  }
}
```

You can even pass in multiple arguments to the hooks:

```javascript
import { Hookified } from 'hookified';

class MyClass extends Hookified {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async myMethodWithHooks() Promise<any> {
    let data = { some: 'data' };
    let data2 = { some: 'data2' };
    // do something
    await this.hook('before:myMethod2', data, data2);

    return data;
  }
}
```
